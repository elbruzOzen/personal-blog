* E. Ozen and A. Orailoglu, “The Return of Power Gating: Smart Leakage Energy Reductions in Modern Out-of-Order Processor Architectures,” *in Architecture of Computing Systems – ARCS 2019*.

The analysis of two efficient heuristics to perform power gating on out-of-order processor execution units. Experiments and power modeling is conducted with Gem5 computer architecture simulator and custom power modeling.

* E. Ozen and A. Orailoglu, “Sanity-Check: Boosting the Reliability of Safety-Critical Deep Neural Network Applications,” *in Asian Test Symposium 2019* [Accepted].

Investigation of linear computation invariants in deep neural network computations. Discovered checksums utilized for low-cost error detection in safety-critical deep neural network applications.

* E. Ozen and A. Orailoglu, “Concurrent Monitoring of Operational Health in Neural Networks Through Balanced Output Partitions,” *in Asia-South Pacific Design Automation Conference 2020* [Accepted].

Multi-objective neural network training with custom penalty functions. The proposed approach introduces low-cost error checking invariants for safety-critical applications and improves the generalization capability of deep neural networks.
