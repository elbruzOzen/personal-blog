I am a second-year Ph.D. student at University of California, San Diego - Computer Science and Engineering Department. My research interests span fault-tolerance and test methods safety-critical architectures, including deep neural network accelerators in automotive. I investigate various algorithm and system-level approaches to design low-cost safety solutions.

You can check my latest CV [here](./assets/elbruz_cv.pdf).
